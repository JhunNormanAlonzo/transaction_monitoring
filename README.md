hi sir PovilasKorop, 

i wonder about the code review in your laraveldaily content
and so much appreciated if you notice me.

my app is working but i dont know if there is part 
that need to optimize or to change.
i will consider my self as newbie in laravel .
i love to watch your laraveldaily tutorials because i learned a lot .
